Load the game into browser and hit deal to start. Then have a choice on whether to hit or stand. Dealer then will draw after player has completed. Dealer draws to 16 and stands on 17.


---- Next Steps ----

Next update is an actual betting system instead of a win/loss scoreboard. An example would be if 10 units were bet and the player were to win, 20 units would be paid out to the player.
